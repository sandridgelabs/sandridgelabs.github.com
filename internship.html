  <h2>Summer 2011 Web Development Internship</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    I am an independent web developer, who is looking for a summer intern to assist on web development this summer.
    I have a list of various projects I'd like to work on, so there would be some flexibility for you to choose a
    project that interests you most. There may also be the possibility of collaborating on a new project proposed by
    you. The primary tools I use are Ruby, Rails, MySQL, CoffeeScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am only accepting one intern this summer. I need help in all aspects of web development, including programming,
    graphic design, and system administration. If any (or all) of these areas interest you, please apply.
  </p>


  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I have been programming computers since I was in high school (about 25 years), with my first paid programming job
    coming my freshman year of college. I have experience in a variety of languages and environments, but now prefer
    working on Macs & Linux, using primarily Ruby. I have 5 years of Ruby experience. I have an interest in mentoring,
    and have mentored others in the past.
  </p>


  <h3>Length / Location</h3>
  <p>
    The duration of the internship is flexible, with a goal of it lasting about 6-12 weeks. There may be an opportunity
    to continue into the fall depending on the situation. The number of hours a week is also flexible, within the range
    of 15-30 hours per week. Work will be completed on site in Arlington, VA, and is a 10-15 minute walk from the
    Clarendon Metro station.
  </p>


  <h3>Qualifications</h3>
  <p>
    At a minimum, you must have moderate computer skills with Mac OS (sorry, no Windows here). For programmers, you
    should also have experience in at least one computer programming language. For system administration, you need to
    have experience on a unix/linux command line. You must be fluent in English.
  </p>


  <h3>Compensation / Credit</h3>
  <p>
    Compensation will vary depending on level of the skills/experience of the intern, ranging from unpaid ($0/hr) to a
    maximum paid compensation of $15/hour. Course credit may also be possible. If interested in credit, please provide
    contact information to the individual or department of your school who is responsible for your school's
    internship program.
  </p>
